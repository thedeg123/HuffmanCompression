An implementation of huffman compression. Linked list and binary trees were implemented by myself.
Written in C.
By David Gold

How to use: Please see man pages.

Programs:
encode -- takes text and compresses it using huffman compression
decode -- takes text compressed with huffman compression and decompresses it.

Files:
encode.c -- methods used by encode.
encode.h -- header for encode
decode.c -- methods used by decode.
decode.h --header for decode.
code.c -- methods used by both decode and encode.
code.h -- header for code.c
encode.1 -- man page for encode
decode.1 -- man page for decode

Problems:
Output of program is in binary as opposed to being converted to ASCII.
